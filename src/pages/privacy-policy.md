## 3. General Notes and Mandatory Information

### Privacy

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. I treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data I collect and what I use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

I would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

### Note to the Responsible Entity

**The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:**

Nikolai Lehbrink - Conception, Design and Development

Phone: 00491794393782
Email: [mail@nikolailehbr.ink](mailto:mail@nikolailehbr.ink)

The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).

### Duration of Storage

Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with me until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless I have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will occur after these reasons cease to apply.

### General Notes on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on This Website

If you have given your consent to data processing, I process your personal data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on ยง 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for the execution of pre-contractual measures, I process your data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, I process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing can also occur on the basis of my legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The respective legal bases applicable in each individual case are informed in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

### Recipients of Personal Data

As part of my business activities, I cooperate with various external entities. Sometimes, it is also necessary to transmit personal data to these external entities. I only transfer personal data to external entities if this is necessary as part of fulfilling a contract, if I are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transferring data to tax authorities), if I have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using contract processors, I only pass on personal data of my customers based on a valid contract for contract processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract on joint processing is concluded.

### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

### Right to Object to the Collection of Data in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

> If data processing is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, I will no longer process your personal data unless I can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (objection under Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR).

> If your personal data is processed for direct advertising purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such advertising; this also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection under Art. 21 Para. 2 GDPR).

### Right to File a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority

In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have a right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. This right to file a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to have data that I process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.

### Information, Correction, and Deletion

Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact me at any time.

### Right to Restriction of Processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact me at any time. The right to restriction of processing applies in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, I usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
- If I no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
- If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, apart from their storage, these data may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

### SSL or TLS Encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to me as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from `http://` to `https://` and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to me cannot be read by third parties.

## 4. Data Collection on This Website

### Cookies

My website uses so-called "cookies". Cookies are small data packets and do not harm your device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or an automatic deletion is carried out by your web browser.

Cookies can be sent by me (first-party cookies) or by third parties (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable certain services of third-party companies to be integrated within websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).

Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other cookies can be used to analyze user behavior or for advertising purposes.

Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions you wish to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies for measuring the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and similar recognition technologies was requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.

### Contact Form

If you send me inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by me for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. I do not share this information without your consent.

The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your request is related to the execution of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on my legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to me (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.

The data you enter in the contact form will remain with me until you ask me to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.

### Inquiries by Email, Phone, or Fax

If you contact me by email, telephone, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by me for the purpose of handling your request. I do not share this information without your consent.

The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your request is related to the execution of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on my legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to me (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time. The data sent by you to me via contact requests remain with me until you request me to delete, revoke your consent to the storage, or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g., after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - especially statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.
