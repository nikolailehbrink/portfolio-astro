[Vite](https://vite.dev/) normally handles files like `.ttf` fonts by [returning their URLs](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-url). That works for most cases, but sometimes you need the imported data in a different format.

I encountered this when trying to [generate dynamic Open Graph images](https://github.com/nikolailehbrink/portfolio/commit/9fcd942ffbfafa31234b75b8c359fa64e65c7373) with [`@vercel/og`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation). The API allows you to embed fonts directly, but it expects the font data as an [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer).

## Why I Didn't Use `fetch` for Loading Fonts

Vercel's own documentation [shows an example](https://vercel.com/guides/using-custom-font) of loading fonts via `fetch` from a URL - either from Google Fonts or from a local file.

I first tried the local file approach, but when deploying to Vercel, I ran into a cross-origin issue. While it worked fine locally, in production the font failed to load reliably.

## Using `vite-plugin-arraybuffer`

Short on time, I turned to [`vite-plugin-arraybuffer`](https://github.com/tachibana-shin/vite-plugin-arraybuffer), which offered a simpler and more reliable solution in my case.

This small plugin lets you import binary files as `ArrayBuffer`s simply by adding a query parameter to the import path:

```ts /?arraybuffer/ filename="app/routes/api/og-image.ts" showLineNumbers
import InterLatin400 from "./inter-latin-400-normal.ttf?arraybuffer";
import InterLatin700 from "./inter-latin-700-normal.ttf?arraybuffer";
```

This syntax is similar to other Vite asset import options, such as `?url` for [explicit URL imports](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html#explicit-url-imports) or `?raw` for [importing files as strings](https://vite.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-string) and made it straightforward to pass font data to `ImageResponse`:

```tsx /InterLatin400/ /InterLatin700/ filename="app/routes/api/og-image.tsx" showLineNumbers=3
import { ImageResponse } from "@vercel/og";

export async function loader({ request }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  // ...
  return new ImageResponse(<div></div>, {
    fonts: [
      { name: "Inter", data: InterLatin400, style: "normal", weight: 400 },
      { name: "Inter", data: InterLatin700, style: "normal", weight: 700 },
    ],
  });
}
```

### TypeScript Support

The plugin also [includes TypeScript support out of the box](https://github.com/tachibana-shin/vite-plugin-arraybuffer?tab=readme-ov-file#typescript-support):

```json filename="tsconfig.json" {3}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vite-plugin-arraybuffer/types"]
  }
}
```
